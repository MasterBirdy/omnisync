Hi, thanks for taking a look at my project. ðŸ‘‹ This project requires npm and node to run.

If you'd like to run it in development mode, simply run:

```
npm run dev
```

If you'd like to run it in production mode, change the NODE_ENV variable to "production". Then run:

```
npm start
```

And you should be good to go!
