Hi, thanks for taking a look at my project. ðŸ‘‹ This project requires npm and node to run.

If you'd like to run it in development mode, simply run:

```
npm start
```

If you'd like to run it in production mode, you'll need to build a production version of the React app. Run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm run build
mv build ..
cd ..
npm start
```

And you should be good to go!
